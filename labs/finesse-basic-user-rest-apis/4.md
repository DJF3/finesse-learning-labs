Changing the user’s state uses the same ``/User`` REST resource and HTTP **PUT** verb as the user Sign In API, but with different XML data in the request Body:
To change to READY:
```xml
<User>
     <state>READY</state>
</User>
```
To change to NOT_READY:
```xml
<User>
     <state>NOT_READY</state>
</User>
```

1. In **Postman**, construct a REST **PUT** request for the ``/User`` resource
 * In the field marked *Enter request URL here*, put the URL for the Finesse API ``/User`` resource with the same {id} as **Step 2: Get the user information section**
 * From the request method dropdown menu, make sure **PUT** is selected
 * Select the **Authorization** tab, and select **Basic Auth**. A form containing username and password appears.
 * For the Basic Auth **username** value, enter the id that was used in the ``/User`` resource
 * For the Basic Auth **password** value, enter the password of the user from the ``/User`` resource
 * Click the **Update request** button to generate an authorization header
 * Select the **Body** tab, and select the **raw** radio button. A dropdown menu containing the type of raw data appears.
 * Select **XML (application/xml)** from the dropdown menu
 * In the large body text box, paste the XML user data as shown above.

4. To confirm that the user was logged in successfully, use the GET user API from the **Step 2: Get the user information section** and verify that the <state> tag value is READY. If you kept the tab from Step 2 opened, switch back to that tab and click the **Send** button.

 5. Repeat steps 1-4 in this section to change the user’s state to NOT_READY by using the XML user data to change the user state to NOT_READY as shown above.
