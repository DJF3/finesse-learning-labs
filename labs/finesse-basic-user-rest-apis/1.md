# Finesse: Basic User REST APIs #

## Objective ##

**Completion time:** 15 minutes

* Use the Finesse API to get information about the user
* Use the Finesse API to login the user
* Use the Finesse API to change the userâ€™s state
* Use the Finesse API to log out the user

## Cisco Finesse
Cisco Finesse is a next-generation agent and supervisor desktop that is part of Cisco's Contact Center/Customer Care solution suite. It is designed to provide a collaborative experience for the various communities that interact with your customer service organization. It helps improve the customer experience while offering a user-centric design to enhance customer care representative satisfaction. Finesse comes with an out of the box agent and supervisor desktop as well as REST APIs and a JavaScript Library API. Developers can easily integrate contact center features into their existing applications by utilizing the Finesse REST APIs. Or, they can use the Finesse JavaScript Library API to integrate their existing applications (via gadgets) into the Finesse agent and supervisor desktop.

## Finesse REST APIs
Cisco Finesse provides REST APIs for performing agent and supervisor actions programmatically. These REST APIs are easy to use, modeled after HTTP, and works in thick and thin client integrations. These REST APIs are used to build the Finesse out of the box agent desktop. The <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/finesse/docs/guides/rest-api-dev-guide" target="_blank">Finesse Developer Guide</a> explains the details for each of the API's.

## Lab Overview
In this lab, we will use the Google Chrome based REST test tool <a href="https://www.getpostman.com" target="_blank">Postman</a> to execute the Finesse REST APIs related to the dialog object. This tool helps simulate an application using Finesse REST APIs. In a production application, you will need to find a library to make REST requests. After completing this learning lab, you will learn how to use the user related REST APIs.

## Step 1: Check that the Finesse system is in service

> Finesse API resource for getting the information about the Finesse system
>  ```http
http://<Finesse_FQDN>:8082/finesse/api/SystemInfo
```
> For more details about /SystemInfo, see <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/media/finesseDevGuide2/CFIN_RF_S6109343_00_systeminfo-get.html" target="_blank">SystemInfo - GET</a>

The ``/SystemInfo`` API response represents the Finesse system and includes the deployment type, the peripheral ID, the installed license, the current system state, the XMPP server and pubSub domains, and the hostnames of the primary and secondary Finesse nodes. This API is primarily used to check the status of the Finesse system. It is important to check the status of the system before using the Finesse REST APIs because the APIs will return an error if the system is out of service. Once the user is successfully logged in, it is no longer necessary to check the status of the system because the user will automatically receive a Finesse notification when the system goes out of service.

1. In **Chrome**, open a browser tab, click the **Apps** button on the shortcut toolbar and select **Postman**.
2. In **Postman**, open a new tab or click the Reset button to clear any previously entered data.
3. Construct a REST **GET** request for the `/SystemInfo` resource.
 * In the field marked *Enter request URL here*, put the URL for the Finesse API ``/SystemInfo`` resource: ``http://{{Finesse_FQDN}}:8082/finesse/api/SystemInfo``.
 * From the request method dropdown menu, select **GET**.

4. Click the **Send** button to launch the request.
5. If the request is successful, you should get a HTTP status of 200 OK and see some XML formatted data with the status of the Finesse system.

6. Confirm that the Finesse system is in service by looking at the `<status>` tag for **IN_SERVICE**. If the Finesse system is not IN_SERVICE, please work with the system administrator to get the system in service before proceeding.
