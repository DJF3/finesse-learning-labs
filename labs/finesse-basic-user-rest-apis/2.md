## Step 2: Get the user information

```

The User object represents an agent or supervisor and includes information about the user, such as roles, state, and teams. 

1. Get the credentials of a user on the Finesse system. Please see the yellow overlay bar at the bottom of the screen for the user credentials.
2. In **Postman**, open a new tab or click the Reset button to clear any previously entered data.
3. Construct a REST **GET** request for the ``/User`` resource
 * In the field marked *Enter request URL here*, put the URL for the Finesse API ``/User`` resource (see the URL listed above). The {id} is the id of the user identified from step 1 in this section.
 * From the request method dropdown menu, make sure **GET** is selected
 * Select the **Authorization** tab, and select **Basic Auth**. A form containing username and password appears.
 * For the Basic Auth **username** value, enter the id that was used in the ``/User`` resource
 * For the Basic Auth **password** value, enter the password of the user from the ``/User`` resource

 * Click the **Update request** button to generate an authorization header
4. Click the **Send** button to launch the request
5. If the request is successful, you should get a HTTP status of 200 OK and see some XML formatted data with information about the user, such as user first name, last name, and user state.

6. If the value of the ``<state>`` tag is not LOGOUT, then the user is already logged in.
 * If the value of the ``<state>`` tag is NOT_READY, you can visit <a href="/lab/finesse-basic-user-rest-apis/step/5">Step #5</a> to log the user out. Then, try the Learning Lab again.
 * If the value of the ``<state>`` tag is READY, you can visit <a href="/lab/finesse-basic-user-rest-apis/step/4">Step #4</a> using the *To change to NOT_READY* for the HTTP request body followed by <a href="/lab/finesse-basic-user-rest-apis/step/5">Step #5</a>. Then, try the Learning Lab again.
7. This step will be repeated throughout this learning lab. To avoid retyping the contents repeatedly, it is best to keep this tab open on Postman throughout the remainder of this learning lab.
